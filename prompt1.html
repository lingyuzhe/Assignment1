<p>
This assignment involves reading data into R from a slightly non-standard format,
exploring it (both numerically and graphically), identifying possible errors, 
summarizing the data,  and finding and communicating aspects of interest.  
As part of the work, you will also work on matching individuals across years
to create longitudinal data. This matching process occurs often
and is challenging and <qt>fuzzy</qt>.
</p>

<p>
The data are results from the Cherry Blossom  10-mile running race,
<a href="http://cherryblossom.org/">http://cherryblossom.org/</a>.
We have these separately for women and men, for years
1999 through 2010. (You can also get the data for 2011 and 2012,
but 2013 and 2014 are in a different and less accessible format.) 
The data are in files named, e.g., <i>women10Mile_1999</i>  and <i>men10Mile_2010</i>.
These are available within the course git repository, within the data/
directory. </p>


<p>
Your assignment is to <strong>a)</strong> read the data into R, and 
<strong>b)</strong> explore different aspects
of the data and offer insights.
This is intentionally open-ended and not prescriptive.
As statisticians and data scientists,  I want you to be able to identify 
questions we can answer with this data and then explore some of these.
The focus is exploratory data analysis and summarizing the major interesting aspects of the data.
If you are drawn to fitting statistical models, do consider whether this is the
most effective way to identify and summarize the insights, and 
also if they are appropriate (e.g., the assumptions for the models are satisfied).
</p>




<p>
You are to use git to manage your work.
Put this in a private <a href="http://bitbucket.org" >bitbucket.org</a> repository so that it is not visible to others.
You can share it with Nick and myself by setting the access rights to include us.

</p>

<h3>The Report</h3>
<p>
Submit a <em>succinct</em> report that summarizes your most interesting
findings. This should explain <em>why</em> they are interesting and provide
evidence for any conclusions, 
typically in the form of graphical displays. Take time to design these displays
so that they are well-labeled, uncluttered, and effectively convey
your conclusions.
Also, discuss the limitations of your conclusions, i.e., other possible
explanations and how likely they are, as well as how you might explore these
further.
The report should be <strong>3 to 5 double-sided pages</strong> (no more), including
tables and figures, but not including code. Reports that are disorganized or
excessively lengthy will be penalized.
Less is more - communicate the essential information, and do not elaborate
for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
You are to present your code in the appendices as R <em>scripts</em>.
Cutting-and-pasting direct input to the R console is not acceptable. Use short
<em>functions</em> with comments and avoid repeating yourself. <strong>Appendix
1</strong> should contain the code for reading the data into R, transforming
the text to numbers, etc. and also validating the data. This should include
small functions for reading individual files. <strong>Appendix 2</strong>
should contain code for creating derived variables, cleaning the data and
creating the summaries you included.
</p>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>
It is important to get started immediately on this project.
There are several parts to it and many details.
</p>

<p>
You must write the code and perform the data analysis yourself.  You may discuss ideas with each other, preferably via
Piazza, but not exchange code.  Please do not post large segments of code to Piazza that you are using to address a question.  If you want
help with problems with your code, simplify the code and post that. Alternatively, post it privately so that Nick and I
can help. However, it is a very important skill to create a minimal example that mimics the problem.  The process of
doing this typically teaches you a lot and helps you to solve the problem
yourself, so this is an essential part of the
learning process.
